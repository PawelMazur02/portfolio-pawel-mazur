# Project Risk Calculator (Excel)

A simple Excel-based tool designed to evaluate project risks by calculating probability, impact and final risk scores.  
The calculator was created as part of coursework related to project management and complements the Travel Cost Calculator web project.

## Scope of the project

1. Risk identification
   - list of potential risks associated with the project
   - qualitative description of causes and effects

2. Probability and impact scoring
   - numerical scoring for likelihood and impact
   - automatic calculation of risk level
   - sorting risks by severity

3. Risk matrix logic
   - formula-based approach
   - classification into categories (low, medium, high)

4. Summary output
   - consolidated risk table
   - highlight of high-risk elements

## Purpose

The tool demonstrates the ability to build a small analytical model in Excel, apply scoring logic, and summarise project risks in a structured way.  
It is a compact example of spreadsheet-based decision support.
