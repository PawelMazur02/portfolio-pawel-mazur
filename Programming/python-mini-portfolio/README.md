# Python Mini Portfolio

This folder contains a collection of small Python programs demonstrating basic programming concepts, data processing and simple algorithms.  
The exercises were created as part of coursework and self-learning.

## Scope of the project

1. Text processing  
   - cleaning text using regular expressions  
   - splitting text into words  
   - building a frequency dictionary of word occurrences  

2. Object-oriented programming  
   - simple class structures (Student, Index)  
   - attributes, methods and data organisation  

3. Numerical and statistical tasks  
   - generating lists of values  
   - calculating mean, minimum, maximum and other statistics  

4. Algorithms  
   - GCD and LCM using the Euclidean algorithm  
   - input validation and error handling  

5. Simple utilities  
   - decorators  
   - greeting functions based on system time  
   - menu-driven scripts  

## Purpose

The project demonstrates the ability to write small, structured Python programs, work with text and numeric data, implement basic algorithms and use object-oriented concepts.

## Files

- `task1.py` – student class and index structure  
- `task2.py` – list analysis and basic statistics  
- `task3.py` – text processing and frequency count  
- `task4.py` – decorators and time-based functions  
- `task5.py` – additional utility functions  
- `NWW_NWD.py` – GCD and LCM algorithms
