# C# Mini Project

A small console-based C# project created as part of coursework.  
The program contains several basic algorithms and simple input/output operations.

## Scope of the project

- menu-driven console interface  
- numerical calculations  
- basic algorithms  
- simple operations on text and numbers  

## Purpose

The project demonstrates the ability to write and structure simple C# programs, work with user input and implement basic algorithms in a console environment.

## Files

- `program.cs` – full source code of the application
